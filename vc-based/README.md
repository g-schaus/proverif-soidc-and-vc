# VC-Based Third Party Authentication Protocol

The VC-based protocol is divided into two different parts: The issuance of the VC by the issuer and its use to access private resources in a pod. Both parts are divided by a fictive sovereignty line, depicting the breaking point at which the issuer loses sight of the users targeted pod, thus increasing their privacy.
